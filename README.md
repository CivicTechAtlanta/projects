## Project tracker for Code for Atlanta ##

Starting in 2020, Code for Atlanta is now tracking all projects here. We're hoping it'll be more online-friendly for folks who want to know which projects are active before coming to a civic hack night.

To see active projects click on [Issues](https://github.com/codeforatlanta/projects/issues/) above.
